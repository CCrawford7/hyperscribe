# Privacy Policy for Hyperscribe

**Last Updated:** November 11, 2025

## Overview

Hyperscribe is committed to protecting your privacy. This privacy policy explains how we handle your data when you use our Chrome extension.

## Data Collection

**We do not collect, transmit, or store any of your personal data on external servers.**

Hyperscribe stores all your data locally on your device using Chrome's local storage API (`chrome.storage.local`). Your notes, settings, themes, templates, and preferences never leave your device.

## What Data We Store Locally

The extension stores the following data locally on your device:

- **Note Content**: The text content of your notes
- **Tabbed Notes**: Multiple note tabs with titles and metadata (premium feature)
- **User Preferences**: Theme selection, font settings, window size, and UI preferences
- **Templates**: Custom note templates you create
- **Settings**: Confirmation dialog preferences (e.g., "don't ask again" checkboxes)

All of this data is stored exclusively in your browser's local storage and is not accessible to us or any third parties.

## Sync Feature (Future)

The sync feature is currently a stub and not functional. When implemented in future versions:

- It will use Chrome's sync storage API (`chrome.storage.sync`) which synchronizes data across your Chrome browsers when you're signed into Chrome
- Data will be encrypted and stored by Google according to their privacy policy
- You will have explicit control to enable or disable sync
- We will update this privacy policy before activating any sync functionality

## Third-Party Services

Hyperscribe does not use any third-party analytics, tracking, or advertising services. We do not:

- Track your usage
- Collect analytics
- Display advertisements
- Share data with third parties
- Use cookies or similar tracking technologies

## Permissions

The extension requires the following Chrome permissions:

- **Storage**: To save your notes and preferences locally on your device
- **Downloads**: To export your notes as text, markdown, or HTML files when you choose to download them

These permissions are used solely for the functionality described and nothing else.

## Data Security

Your data is stored locally on your device and protected by your device's security measures. We recommend:

- Keeping your operating system and browser updated
- Using strong device passwords/encryption
- Regularly backing up important notes by exporting them

## Children's Privacy

Hyperscribe does not knowingly collect any information from children under 13. Since we don't collect any data at all, the extension is safe for users of all ages.

## Changes to This Policy

We may update this privacy policy from time to time. Any changes will be posted in this document with an updated "Last Updated" date. Continued use of Hyperscribe after changes constitutes acceptance of the updated policy.

## Data Deletion

To delete all data stored by Hyperscribe:

1. Right-click the Hyperscribe extension icon
2. Select "Remove from Chrome"
3. Confirm the removal

This will permanently delete all locally stored notes and settings. You can also clear data from within the extension's settings panel.

## Contact

If you have questions about this privacy policy or Hyperscribe's data practices, please create an issue on our GitHub repository or contact us through the Chrome Web Store support channels.

## Your Rights

Since all data is stored locally on your device:

- You have complete control over your data
- You can export your notes at any time
- You can delete all data by removing the extension
- No data is shared with us or third parties

## Compliance

This extension complies with:

- Chrome Web Store Developer Program Policies
- General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR)
- California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA)

Since we collect no personal data, most data protection regulations do not apply to our extension's operation.
